### Hot Dogs

## Project Overview
Developed a single page view application using React featuring over hundreds of pictures of dogs of all different breeds. The user can also filter by breed, as well as save to a list of favorites to be viewed in a separate page (feature under construction). All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

## Functionalities
A dropdown of breeds is provided which is set to 'all breeds' by default and can be changed to filter by any breed.
The page loads data using the modern custom infinite scrolling functionality.
The application also filters for duplicates and ensures that the user is only seeing new content.
A sleek navigation bar that helps send the user to different routes in the app.
A scroll component that allows the user to swiftly return to the top of the page.
Add to a list of favorites to be viewed in a separate page (feature under construction).
All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.
